# Unit-Conversion-React-&-Flask

Using Toggle in React JS, Converting the unit of three field (Distance, Mass, Temperature, ...More your can add.) from SI System to Imperial System also reverting to original values on switching off the toggle. This conversion is taking place on Frontend side only.

You can convert unit in same System as well by selecting unit from drop-down.

Just for the practice purpose I implement same conversion using Python Flask app also in which backend API is playing it's role. After backend implementation, this app is tested using Postman.
